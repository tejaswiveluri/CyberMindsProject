Much of this research has addressed issues related to maternal parenting and psychopathology (namely, maternal depression and ADHD). 

A secondary line of research, conducted in collaboration with faculty in Human Development, aims to examine the trajectory of young children displaying early behavioral inhibition, including the development of psychopathology, and to intervene by targeting key moderators of outcome (e.g., parenting and social relationships). 

Recent projects conducted by Dr. Chronis-Tuscano‚Äôs research group include: (1) the development and evaluation of an integrated parenting program for depressed mothers of children with ADHD; (2) examination of early predictors of developmental outcomes in a large sample of preschool-aged children with and without ADHD; and (3) development and evaluation of a parent-child intervention for families of inhibited preschool-aged children.

Dr. Chronis-Tuscano is the Associate Editor of the Journal of Clinical Child & Adolescent Psychology; on the APA Division 12 Presidential Task Force on Enhancing Graduate Training in Evidence-Based Practice in Psychology; and serves the Scientific Advisor to the NIMH Outreach Partnership with the State of Maryland.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/kennedysarvis/,,"My passion for English was ignited by my sociology students. In school many students come into the academic process of higher learning unable to read and write at the college level. So, while sociology is a research-based discipline it is my job as an educator to produce better writers. It has been essential for me to find unique and creative ways to bridge the gap between the discipline of psychology, sociology, and English. It takes a unique skill to make these genres coexist within the confines of the classroom. What I think is extremely unique is my ability to take the textbook and make it come to life where the words leap off the page and into the hearts and minds of young learners no matter what level they enter my classroom. 

I feel strongly that psychology and sociology need one another to coexist or at least to explain why it is that our students come to us with some awareness of the environment around them. It is my job to help them see not only the world around them from a different context, but to also see themselves. Take sociology and psychology for example, in the sense that everything that we go through in our day-to-day existence impacts our lives on some micro or macro socio-economical level. One does not simply face various healthcare and economic disparities because of their gender, race, class, or religion. But rather it is a culmination of these factors. For example, intersectionality deems that if one is female, Hispanic, working poor, and Catholic; the outcome of the disparities and institutional markers she faces are her lived experience-not experienced separately but simultaneously. Thus, you take that same woman, after looking at how these social factors can impact her daily and I often ask myself what bearing do these indicators have on her emotional and psychological wellbeing? Consequently, making these two disciplines coexist. There is a direct correlation between the social aspects of human life and how they experience the world around them based on their race, class, gender, etc. as well as the psychological implications or the power one‚Äôs social world has on their emotions, personality, and psyche. Therefore, sociology and psychology should be looked at in a contextual framework of coexistence.

After the 9/11 attacks, my career took on more complex and significant challenges as I traveled to remote areas of the world in support of international objectives.

I served as a the Chief of Instruction at the FBI Academy where I had the privilege of mentoring instructors, New Agents and New Intelligence Analyst Trainees. This rewarding opportunity enabled me to leverage my experience to prepare, motivate, and inspire the next generation of FBI leaders. One of the most important responsibilities I had was ensuring those I served found meaningful purpose and connection to one another as well as to the greater mission. I am an accomplished leader focused on inspiring and motivating others to realize their true potential and to believe in themselves. 

While I have received numerous formal awards and recognition, I find the greatest reward in helping others to grow and succeed. There is nothing more inspiring than to watch those I have mentored begin to recognize their own potential as they develop and flourish. By establishing cultures of genuine care, mutual accountability, and inspired success, I have consistently led resilient teams which have exceeded organizational goals and expectations.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/shreya-agrawal/,,"An ardent problem-solver, my primary goal is to improve human lives while creating business value. In order to build and ship scalable products that users (actually) need, I'm honing three core skills: 

üåø Driving efficient collaboration within cross-functional and cross-cultural teams
üåø Data Analytics for Business Impact
üåø Product Road-mapping, Strategy and feature development

I have experience working as a data-driven PM intern for start-ups at different stages of their product life-cycle. Currently a Technical PM @ Heali AI, I'm driving engineering workflow in an agile environment to ship the product to release. Over the summer I built a Deep Learning based functionality for Quantime (an AI-driven calendar), which helped me gain development perspective as well. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At Columbia, I engaged in Industry and academic projects in Data Science, Human-Centered Design, and Lean Methodology. Along the way, I have picked up related hard skills and effective leadership. I credit my Undergraduate years at IIT Madras in shaping a math enthusiast and logical thinker into a doer and a team-player.

Before this, I worked as a Finance Operation Analyst at Larson & Toubro Ltd., where I have got over half a decade of hands-on experience in Handling Budgets, Cost Analysis, Predictive Risk, and Finance Analysis. Also, I received managerial expertise in laying out analytical roadmaps for diverse finance problems in Banking, Retail(online/offline), insurance, and the Petroleum industry.

My belief defines me. Strong conviction in forecasting over what I know, keeps me motivated to keep up pace with the ever-evolving Finance Industry. Practicing extreme experimentation makes sure I never run out of solutions. Interdisciplinary exposure gives me the perspective to visualize multiple facets of the future risk and encourages me to mitigate it in an unorthodox way if needed. First principles thinking helps me to strip the dread from Finance analytics and put it into lucid terms for clear actionable business insights.

He has decided to focus his sights on global studies to expand his world view and understanding of social justice as it relates to the entire globe. 

When he isn't working, Torrey can be found loudly rooting for the Baltimore Ravens, Orioles, or any other Maryland sports team that he can. He also can be found reading a good book from time to time, with a cup of tea!

https://www.linkedin.com/in/baptistebouvier/,,"Born to French and Japanese parents, I've been blessed to live in the beautiful cities of Tokyo, Sydney, London and Boston throughout my life. I owe a great amount to my parents for an environment that was both flexible enough for me to follow my different dreams and firm enough to help me identify and stay true to my values. I'm grateful to them for speaking to me in their own native languages from birth, and I've continued that love for cultures by pursuing Chinese for the last seven years.

It doesn't make sense for any one culture to have identified the best way to live life. And so I'm fascinated about differences and will take any chance to have my assumptions tested. I do that through hosting a podcast, readings books from different cultures, and having conversations with as many people as possible.

At MIT and in my life, this translates into work in negotiation and conflict resolution (e.g., helping to teach the undergraduate negotiation class, doing research with HKS on negotiations in moments of crisis), public policy (e.g., supporting the Australian government to apply machine learning to education datasets), healthcare (e.g., developing a computer vision algorithm to detect diabetes from iris images), and entrepreneurship (e.g., starting MIT's first entrepreneurship club; supporting the governor of KY to promote entrepreneurship).",Computer Science & Political Science @ MIT,"New York, New York, United States",Baptiste,Bouvier,Baptiste Bouvier,3rd,ACoAACFv3JkBrJmWqw8rtFMIFpeiTKIFHrba5GE,560979097,"https://www.linkedin.com/sales/people/ACoAACFv3JkBrJmWqw8rtFMIFpeiTKIFHrba5GE,name",500,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAACFv3JkBrJmWqw8rtFMIFpeiTKIFHrba5GE%22%5D&facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%2C%22S%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAACFv3JkBrJmWqw8rtFMIFpeiTKIFHrba5GE%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&RESULT_TYPE=PEOPLE,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://www.linkedin.com/company/1503/,Researcher and Teaching Assistant,"Research on the topic of negotiations in a period of crisis, interviewing over 50 leaders of multilateral organisations like the World Bank and the UN.

I am currently pursuing a degree in Political Science with a focus on Public Policy and a minor in International Business at George Washington University.

My time as a Research Assistant at the university has honed my abilities in both communication and education while also providing me with valuable real-world experience in various fields that intersect with the law.

My diverse background, ranging from my role as a scheduling and financing intern to my position as an education fellow studying the effects of consumer finance, has equipped me with a unique set of experiences and skills that I am eager to bring to any opportunity.

In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I am actively engaged in a number of organizations that align with my values and interests. I serve as co-director of education and advocacy for my university's chapter of Democracy Matters, and I am an integral member of the Professional and Academic Affairs Committee of Phi Alpha Delta Pre-Law society. I am also thrilled to have recently joined the GW Hatchet as a Culture Reporter, where I hope to bring fresh perspectives and engage in thought-provoking discussions.

Director of IT, Healthcare IT, CIO Healthcare, Project Manager, Epic Project Manager

Business Manager responsible for the implementation of technology in medical centers and clinics in the Greater Minneapolis-St. Paul Area.  My focus is on combining software technology along with workflow analysis techniques to improve provider and nurse workflow.  It is my strong belief that if providers and nurses have smooth workflow after go-live then they will be much more efficient and thus both patient care and the bottom line is positively affected.  I see this as a major key to the implementation of an EHR/EMR.

 I currently work as a  Business Information Analyst II at Anthem, Inc. As a part of my current job role I have gained immense knowledge on the Health Care systems. I even got a chance to even work alongside major companies such as Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota and Prime Therapeutics. 

Prior to my current job, I worked as a Database Administrator/Business Analyst Co-Op at North Memorial Health Care, Minneapolis. Though being offered an internship for just 5 months in the start, moving forward looking at my capabilities and learning abilities my internship was extended. During my stay in the USA, I have also worked as a Tech Student at the university.

 Coming from a background where I have been taught to value the significance of education, I am proud to have reached this stage in my life. I graduated as a full time Graduate student in the Information Technology program with a Business Analysis certification at the University of St. Thomas, Minnesota in the month of May, 2018. I also did my under graduation in Information Technology from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University-Hyderabad. I was awarded the ""Best Academic Performer"" award in my first year of under-graduate study. Alongside, I also received the prestigious IEEE Computer Society Richard E. Merwin Student scholarship in the year 2016 for my extraordinary academic skills and professional efforts.

 Four to five years from now, I picture myself among a group of like-minded researchers in the field of Information Technology giving my utmost suggestions and ideas. I am confident that my professional experiences, sharp aptitude and strong incentives will assist me in successfully accomplishing the goals I have set for myself.

After graduating from Virginia Tech with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics, I spent a couple of years living in Melbourne, Australia, working as a Software Developer for Cru, a non-profit organization. Coming back to the US, I spent a few years looking after some sick family members before working at Sam‚Äôs Club as a Department Manager.

Knowing that I wanted to use my math prowess to land a job, I decided to head back to school to refine and update my skills. I chose to pursue a Data Science career because it combines my aptitude for numbers, coding, and helping people.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/macy-pope-150962197/,,"When I was in 3rd grade, I learned about recycling in class and was so excited to tell my mom about how we could help the Earth by doing it at home.  This was the first moment whenI truly realized just how important the environment is to me.  Throughout my entire education, from grade school to undergrad, I have been passionate about what I and others can do to save our world from climate change. This drive has translated into my interests in humanitarianism, ecological critical theory, and helping marginalized groups.

While in undergraduate school at Marymount University, I studied both English (Writing) and Philosophy.  The areas of study that I am most interested in are applied ethics, law, writing, editing, graphic design, data analysis, and sustainability/environmental advocacy.  My plan after graduating is to find a great, supportive place to work before I then transition to law school.  Office feel and company missions are very important to me when evaluating new jobs/opportunities.  I hope to graduate law school in or around 2027, with specific concentrations in legal writing and environmental law.

- Humanitarian Ethics & Law
- Environmental Law
- Environmental Action

https://www.linkedin.com/in/benfanworks/,,"Have you thought about what reality is like? Like, do colors exist or not? I‚Äôm a PhD student in Philosophy at the University of Maryland, College Park, and this is what I get paid to do on a fairly regular basis. While asking these abstract questions is fun, what I find most rewarding about the program is the opportunity to hear what the next generation of college students thinks in the courses that I teach. Surprisingly, my last batch of students was fairly willing to go along with the idea that we don't have free will.

When I'm not thinking about reality and how weird it is, I'm probably learning about data. Data is increasingly playing a larger and larger role in the way that companies operate, and it is probably the realest manifestation of the platitude ""knowledge is power."" I'm interested in seeing how a philosophical background might bring a fresh perspective to the field of data analytics. In the introductions of many online data science courses, students are told that data science and data analysis are about storytelling. In the world of philosophy, it's about asking the right questions. When the two are combined, the thought is that the right questions will be answered in the best way possible - this is the result that I'm after.

If you're interested in talking about how to harness the most job-desperate market for the sake of analyzing data and pursuing the right questions, feel free to shoot me an email at mr.benfan@gmail.com!

Is there any hope for Africa in the new millennium?
THE FREE AFRICA FOUNDATION (FAF) believes there is hope for Africa and progress can be made. FAF is a non-profit, non-ideological, non-political and non-denominational organization dedicated to reversing Africa's economic decline. The Foundation is a coterie of serious-minded African reformers and thinkers, drawn from Africa and Africans in the diaspora, whose preoccupation is crafting new, African-based and non-governmental strategies and solutions to tackle Africa=s crises. These new ideas are then channeled to progressive indigenous NGOs in Africa that are affiliated with FAF. They are provided with assistance and support to carry out these reform initiatives and programs.

Analysis has always been a skill of mine.

Being personable and open-minded has also helped me establish healthy relationships with those around me, facilitating collaboration and ensuring the creation of a positive environment. Though I am more business-oriented, I find that philosophy encourages me to think more abstractly and cultivates creativity.

Throughout my studies, I have developed a deep understanding of policy and government, which has enabled me to conduct high-quality research and analysis on a variety of issues.

In addition, I gained valuable experience as a section editor for William & Mary's newspaper, The Flat Hat, where I honed my skills in editing and learned the importance of crafting clear and compelling messages. My experience as an intern for the Missouri Public Defender system also strengthened my skills in legislative tracking and policy analysis, and taught me the importance of advocacy and the need for effective policies that promote fairness and justice for all.

I am excited to apply my skills and experience to a career in policy analysis or related fields, and I am committed to using my expertise to make a meaningful contribution to society.

‚ÄúMerging people, technology, and processes to move business forward‚Äù

If I were to describe myself in a just a few words, I would say that I am an ambitious, progressive, initiative-taking, and experienced financial professional, offering 15+ years of excellent communication, critical thinking skills and analytical acumen, with added strengths in project management, process improvement, reporting/analyses, budgeting, and team leadership. I continue to be positively challenged through efforts to identify, develop, track and report on business processes, key performance indicators, cost-control initiatives, process improvement plans, and  staff development programs. I am fortunate to have worked with some of the best organizations, and with the best people. Throughout my career, I always looked for the opportunity to take on additional responsibilities of higher expectation and challenge, managing multimillion-dollar projects by balancing sound business judgment, a strong sense of urgency, excellent financial/accounting analyses, and a quality-driven focus. These are the qualities that have enabled me to exceed goals and get the impossible accomplished. 

I like to tackle problems head-on, work smart, and resolve issues with a ‚Äúdo it right, the first time and all the time‚Äù credo, while seeking out better ways to look at problems and determine solutions. I am a firm believer in continued education and training, and in fact I received my dual Master of Business Administration/Master of Accountancy in 2021, and a Bachelor of Art in Studio Art in 2003. In addition, I am studying for my CPA certification, which I anticipate I will complete in 2022. I am well regarded for my ability to work collaboratively across disparate endpoints to ensure an efficiency-centric and quality-driven culture that exceeds organizational objectives. Lastly, I feel strongly that professional presence, lead-by-example work style, tact, and bilateral communication are lost arts ‚Äì but shouldn‚Äôt be.

Diligent and dedicated, excited and eager, intuitive and inquisitive, precise and proud; these are a few alliterations that describe me to a T.

I am a Metrologist that works with high accuracy, high precision measurement systems that include standard table CMM's (Renishaw/Mitutoyo), Articulated Arms (FARO), Laser Trackers (FARO, LEICA), Photogrammetry, Projector, and structured light scanning. In addition to my wide range of experience with metrology equipment, I am adept with the interfacing software associated with these powerful inspection tools; most notably, I have experience with Polyworks, Spatial Analyzer, Verisurf, PC-DMIS, and CAM2.

My passion for metrology is derivative from my love for mathematics which I studied intensively at Kent State University. 

I began my career in the automotive OEM industry at RB&W MFG, working with a team of experienced design, applications, and quality engineers who pushed me, not to learn fast, but to learn smart. It was in this emergent stage of my career that I developed critical quality professional skills like GD&T, hand tool inspections, tooling, material testing, CMM operation and programming, and APQP fundamentals. 

Continuing this development of quality engineering skills, I went on to AT&F Co., where I was challenged to grow fast.  Here I learned the ins and outs of Portable CMM technology. At AT&F, I utilized PCMM technology to direct the fabrication, machining, and assembly of large components for the ship building of aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/ernesto-vazquez/,,"I have over 10 years of experience in the Manufacturing Industry arena. To say that this industry is a passion is an understatement, as it is a love that has continuously helped me overcome obstacles, embrace challenges, and keep my career moving forward. I‚Äôve had the opportunity to add a range of experience to my repertoire, including Machine Shop Supervisor, Jr Engineering Designer, CNC Machinist, and Programmer, just to name a few.

Along the way, I also discovered different views of manufacturing, during my initial years of this passion I have designed, fabricated, or sold parts and machines for major industrial companies (medical and food) in Puerto Rico such as Johnson and Johnson, Coca Cola Puerto Rico Bottlers, Johnson & Johson, Amgen Ltd, and  Nypro Puerto Rico Inc. I have stepped into a more challenging role as a CNC Operator/Setter for Windham Manufacturing, when I moved to Dallas, Texas. Learning how to set up, manufacture, and measure parts with tight tolerances. I strive to focus on lean manufacturing, fast production process, collaboration, mentorship, communication, and also help every team member be at their best. I'm currently a CNC Programmer/Supervisor/Engineering Technician for a major manufacturer of engine radiators, Thermal Solutions Manufacturing. 

Graduated recently as a CAD Designer Associate Degree program with the mission of career growth and development.

Most notably, I am currently undergoing the CPA licensure process. Reading a FAR textbook has become one of my most frequent pastimes! 

I spent the first two years of my career specializing in income taxation in the public sector. Innately, I was further malleated into a flexible and reliable professional with a high drive for efficient and precise output. Extreme attention to detail encapsulated with organization and logical thinking powers my performance. Furthermore, I exemplify an innate duty to perform, while harmonizing the utilitarian balance between client and company interests.

I then continued my career into the private sector, transitioning to accounting for commercial infrastructure portfolios on a global basis with key empahsis in renewable energy develpoment. In respect to the climate issues facing our planet, I feel honored to contribute to this initiative revitalizing worldy infrastructure within sustainability's constraints.
